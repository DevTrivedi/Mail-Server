It takes data from a predefined excel file that contains the data i.e. Email ID of the students, Attachment which you want to send with the mail and the date on which you want to send them an email. The sample excel file is present to make you aware of the format.

**Usage:**

A predefined excel file with sample data is available with the repository, download it and make all necessary modifications required. Run the Mail Server.py file, provide a valid email id and password from which you want to send the email to others. Now locate and select the Excel file, then provide the appropriate sheet name of the selected excel file. If these steps are followed properly the email will be sent successfully.
